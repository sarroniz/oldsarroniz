  title={Joke Comprehesion by Spanish B2 level learners of English: A preliminary empirical study.},
  author={Arróniz, S.},
  year={2019},
  abstract={This work undertakes an empirical study of one of the least researched issues in interlanguage pragmatics so far{:} comprehension of jokes by Spanish learners of English as a second language (L2, henceforth). It seeks to examine whether these learners grasp the humor some joking texts are intended to produce, which types of jokes prove to be more difficult to understand and why. Adopting a relevance-theoretic perspective on comprehension, and, more precisely, the model of comprehension envisaged in the cognitive-pragmatic framework put forward by Sperber and Wilson (1986/1995), this work relies on the classification of jokes recently proposed by Yus (2016), where jokes are sorted out into seven different types depending on three parameters which are purportedly exploited by humorists in their creation and are, therefore, responsible for their triggering the expected effect. Consequently, this work presents the results obtained through an online questionnaire that was administered to students of English as an L2 with an upperintermediate, B2 level who were enrolled in one of the compulsory courses of the Degree in English Studies taught at the Universidad de Sevilla. Owing to its limitations, this work cannot but be considered an initial, exploratory study that aims to spark off further research contributing to a better and deeper understanding of the problems that L2 learners may face when processing humorous texts.},

  abstract={While it is known that increasing learner awareness of pragmatics can lead to cross cultural communication, and that pedagogical intervention can improve learners’ cultural awareness of pragmatics, there remains little explicit instruction on formulaic pragmatic expressions in Spanish. The present unit of instruction provides teachers and learners with an activity to teach acceptances and refusals in Spanish through the use of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC). It utilizes Scollon and Scollon’s (2001) model of politeness which incorporates the notion of ‘self’ when teaching acceptances and refusals to invitations.},

  title={Giving response to gratitude expressions in bilingual contexts: A contrastive analysis between American English and Spanish.},
  author={Arróniz, S.},
  year={2016},
  abstract={The current study sets out to investigate variation in the speech act of responding to gratitude expression among bilingual speakers. It has been proposed in previous studies (Schneider, 2005; Bieswanger, 2015) that in this particular speech act there can be a variety of strategies that monolingual speakers use to respond to thanks, but no focus has been put in an English-Spanish bilingual community. In this sense, the present research starts from those studies, and looks for the differences or similarities that may occur between bilingual and monolingual speakers. In order to do so, the first thing to consider is the norm in both languages, and then have a look at what really happens in a bilingual context. For this purpose, a DCT was spread among monolingual Spanish speakers to obtain their norm, and then, together with the norm in English obtained in previous research (Schneider, 2005; Bieswanger, 2015), compare both using natural data collected in a bilingual context. Overall, the results obtained from the data collected proved that there are some differences in fact in the way bilingual speakers behave when responding to thanks, showing an accommodation/assimilation to their L2, using strategies that were more common among the opposite community.},

  author={Arróniz, S. and Coulter-Kern, M.},
  year={2017},
  abstract={The present study attempts to 1) identify significant differences in the acquisition of trills by non-native Spanish speakers after heterosyllabic consonants and 2) present these differences quantitatively. This study is primarily concerned with at what point in acquisition do learners begin to produce trills after heterosyllabic consonants and how can we measure their progress as related to productions of a native speaker.}

  title={Impoliteness strategies in the L2 classroom setting: Conventionalized formulaic sequences in Spanish.},
  author={Arróniz, S.},
  year={2018},
  abstract={The present study aims to investigate the acquisition of impoliteness formulaic sequences in Spanish as a second language in the classroom setting. For those purposes, we want to observe the number of impolite expressions that students at different levels of proficiency know, and if they can use them in context. We will use two different tasks in our study. The first one is a recognition task, based in Bardovi-Harlig and Bastos (2010). With this instrument, we aim to see if students can recognize impolite formulas. In the second task, a production task, we used an oral DCT with 12 different situations, and for each of them, we ask the students to provide an oral response. We will analyze the data obtained with these two instruments and categorize the productions according to Culpeper’s (2011, 2017) taxonomy of conventionalized impolite expressions. We propose that because students are not very familiar with this type of language, a pedagogical intervention could be proposed in a future study to include these expressions in the L2 Spanish classroom.},

  author={Arróniz, S. and Coulter-Kern, M.},
  year={2022},
  abstract={This study investigates the acquisition and production of the trill in Spanish following heterosyllabic consonants (e.g. honrar) in advanced undergraduate participants and graduate students and uses native speakers (NS) as a baseline. The present study uses a variationist approach to investigate the social and individual factors that may impact the acquisition of the trill following heterosyllabic consonants, a cluster which has been described in previous studies as a trill, even though it is not orthographically written as two r's, as in 'carro'. We are using a variationist approach to analyze both learner and NS production of the trill in Spanish using both formal and informal production instruments. We investigate motivation using the motivational framework and operationalizations of Ought-to self oriented motivation and L2 Context oriented motivation used by Dörnyei and Ushioda (2009). Our study investigates the impact of L2 Context oriented motivation (e.g. motivation to be part of a Spanish speaking community or the speakers of a specific Spanish speaking context) vs. Ought-to self oriented motivation (motivation to speak Spanish for class/work purposes or because one feels they Ought-to be able to) as well as social variables such as time spent abroad on the acquisition of the trill following heterosyllabic consonants.},

  title={Intonation and attitudes: Examining language attitudes toward Catalan by Peninsular Spanish speakers.},
  author={Arróniz, S.},
  year={2020},
  abstract={Research on language attitudes toward certain community groups is extensive and covers a wide range of phenomena and languages. This paper aims to investigate whether intonation, as a prosodic component and, frequently, a distinctive feature of certain languages, can trigger different attitudes, depending on whether or not the identity of the speaker is disclosed. To this end, a group of ten speakers of peninsular Spanish participated in a perception study in which pitch modifications were used with a synthetic voice to reflect intonation contours specific to neutral polar questions and information-seeking wh-questions in two languages in contact{:} Spanish and Catalan. The participants heard two versions of each token, both of them in Spanish, but one with a Castilian-accented L+H* intonation, and the other with a Catalan-accented H+L* intonation. Subsequently, they heard the same audio recordings once again, but this time the place of origin of each manipulation was disclosed; that is, either from Madrid (Castilian) or Catalonia (Catalan). The results confirm not only that intonation is a linguistic trait that does trigger attitudes on its own, but also that there is a strong social dimension to how Spanish speakers perceive Catalan, beyond language.},

  title={Joke identification, comprehension and appreciation by Spanish intermediate ESL learners: An exploratory study.},
  author={Arróniz, S. and Padilla Cruz, M.},
  year={2022},
  abstract={This paper reports on an exploratory study examining joke identification, appreciation and comprehension by Spanish intermediate ESL learners. The study is based on a relevance-theoretic classification of jokes, which assumes that humorousness results from manipulation of three parametres{:} make-sense frames, cultural information and utterance interpretation. It firstly ascertains whether Spanish ESL learners recognise orally-delivered samples of seven types of purportedly jocular texts. Secondly, it examines whether these learners actually regard such texts as comical and why. Finally, it looks into the learners’ interpretative problems in order to single out which joke type(s) is/are more challenging. The study relies on quantitative and qualitative data elicited through an online questionnaire comprising four tasks. The results indicate no correlation between joke identification and appreciation, and independence of successful joke recognition from sophisticated interpretative skills. Jokes involving invalidation of an activated make-sense frame were most easily identified and found most funny, but jokes exploiting cancellation of an initial, seemingly plausible, interpretation posed more difficulties.},
