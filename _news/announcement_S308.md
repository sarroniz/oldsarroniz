**You are invited!**

Our students will be presenting creative artistic projects in which they have reinvented a form, an idea or a concept, inspired by films we have been analyzing throughout the semester. Please come check out their creative products presented in Spanish. Feel free to visit for a few minutes, visit more than one session, or come to all of them.
