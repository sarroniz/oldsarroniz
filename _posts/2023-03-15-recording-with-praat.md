## Recording a new audio with PRAAT

1. First, make sure you have a microphone connected to your computer. You can use a professional microphone, but if you do not have one of those, you can use your headphones's microphone instead. Avoid recording with the computer's built-in microphone, unless you are sure it is a very good one. 

2. To record a new audio with Praat, go to "New" > "Record mono sound".

3. A new window will pop up. Leave the default settings, and give the file a name. Then, click "Record" to start recording and "Stop" when you finish.

4. **Don't forget to save the file before you close the window!** PRAAT does not automatically save anything. You can either "Save to list" or "Save to list & Close". This step will only save your file in the left panel, but you still need to save it in your computer (see step 5).

5. Finally, to save the file in your computer, click the file's name on the left panel, and then click "Save" > "Save as WAV file".
